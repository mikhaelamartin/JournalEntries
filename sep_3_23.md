## Supersight - Entry #4

Sight is arguably the most important sense. So it may not be a surprise that “when town councils meet to review a worthy proposal for something like bike lanes, it is often vetoed because people can’t imagine it, and are therefore hesitant to spend their budget”. The author argues that one of the benefits of using AR is that it can be used as a visual aid to better understand history and the future. Rose points out how schools tend to focus more on the theory aspect of learning and not the doing, which leads to students unable to fully grasp concepts that are not found in everyday life. So in theory, AR should improve our comprehension of ideas that we can’t currently see with the naked human eye.
The book “Make it Stick” talks about the different aspects of optimal learning including practicing recall through flashcards or testing oneself and interleaving topics so as to not rotely memorize topics based on order. The book talks about how types of learners are not a real science-based concept (visual, kinesthetic, etc.) and that there are inherently some subjects that everyone could learn better by visualizing such as dancing. So, I’m wondering whether it’s necessary to actually add an AR visual aid for all types of subjects or just certain ones.
