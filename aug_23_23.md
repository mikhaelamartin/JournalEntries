## Supersight - Entry #2

One of the beauties of life is building your own path. Despite others telling you where to go or circumstances steering your course, it’s ultimately up to you how you respond to the cards you are dealt with. 

The author describes a scenario in which you enter a retail store where “your glasses will dynamically display certain products, flag loyalty discounts, and spotlight recommended products that fit you, compliment what you're wearing now, or even fill a gap it “sees” in your at-home wardrobe” (pg 41). This all sounds amazing in reducing decision fatigue, limiting time spent running errands, and ultimately dressing your best. 

But I am also reminded of one of the central ideas in the book *Range* by David Epstein. He argues that optimizing everything may actually be inferior to exploring all the options presented to you. What if you came to the store with a set list of products to buy but venturing around the store led you to discover unrelated but awesome products? We've all experienced times where we enter Target with a goal but end up with other random products. Depending on how you look at it, both options can be good or bad for your wallet, self-control, future self, etc. Also, adopting an AI that functions in that manner might not be a good business model for the retailer since they are limiting opportunities for the consumer to buy other products. 

Again, technology advancements leads to both pros and cons on the individual, business, and societal level.
