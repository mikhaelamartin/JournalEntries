## Supersight - Entry #3

The author introduces the idea of AR coaches to guide different aspects of our life. "They shouldn't prescirbe convserations or behaviors so much as prompts and cues to form better habits and richer connections with each other" (page 77). One example includes a wellbeing coach that helps track our sleep quality, eating habits, and stress levels. While seemingly helpful towards those who struggle to juggle physical and mental health with the ebbs and flows of everyday life, I personally don't think that this approach will resolve every roadblock. Habits are what behaviors are based on so I'm not sure what the author means by the above quote. AI that whispers areas of opportunity to go walking or to intake more vegetables are great, but I also think the individual themself needs to develop a shift in mindset. Sure, the AI can contribute to that but I wouldn't believe that success would come 100% from the AI. Especially if you have the ability to personalize your settings. It's like asking your phone to block you from using an app after 15 minutes, of course you're going to suspend it if you're really desperate. Maybe I'm overlooking some factors but I don't believe that AI will ever be able to replace real humans or even yourself in fully driving you to meet your health goals.
