## Supersight - Entry #1
I picked up the book Supersight by David Rose last week to better inform myself about the potential future of Augmented Reality (AR) and how it relates to Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

Within the first two chapters, the author paints several scenes depicting the possibilities of AI-powered glasses. For example, identifying peoples’ names without asking, reading the history of a forest tree trunk, or personalizing billboard advertisements. Honestly, I felt deeply bothered and scared. 

Firstly, I feel that being inundated with this extra information may potentially be a hindrance and a danger to one's cognitive abilities and mental health. The maximalist mindset definitely has its pros and cons but I wonder what future (or historical) studies will say about our ability to process and synthesize such a plethora of information.

Secondly, I am reminded of Uncle Ben’s famous saying, “With great power comes great responsibility” as all of prospective features are not without the management of companies having different interests, biases, and sources of funding. 

But rather than cowering in fear, I think it’s important to be aware of these ideas so that myself and others can have more productive discussions about their impact on different areas in society.
