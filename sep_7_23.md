## Supersight - Entry #5

Ross discusses the ways that AR can motivate anyone to adopt new habits and this mindset is already apparent in social media sites. Like being able to see the number of likes on a photo, the number of views on a video, the sentiments of any post. Ross believes that  “the motivational power of gamification is irrefutable: accountability, transparency, and better performance for individuals, teams, and organizations” (page 162). He argues that AR can help everyday people reach their goals by quickly glancing at metrics with their Supersight powers. I believe that habit tracking can be beneficial in a plethora of goals including walking x number of steps a day, getting y hours of deep sleep, and intaking z ounces of water. But I can see how it can quickly become an obsession. The author also hopes to incorporate these features into our reality at-a-glance so as not to distract the user. But I think this is just another example of quick context-switching so the user is by definition paying attention to something different from their immediate task. Overall, I do like the sentiment the author is proposing about gamifying the world so we can better meet our goals, but there are still downsides to making metrics easier to visibly see.
